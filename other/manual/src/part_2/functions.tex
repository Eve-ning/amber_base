\part{Functions}

This is the part that becomes confusing, however, it's important to define every single nook and cranny of this 

\section{Stutter}

Let's say we have a vector of offsets, we need to ask a few questions before we can generate a Stutter that works.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Should we entrust the task of assigning the offsets to the user?
	
	We should! Split the work so that it's more specific
	\item Can we determine if it's valid?
	
	We can apply a precursory check towards the input to see if the both the value and size is valid
	
	\item Can we omit certain traits if needed?
	
	We also need to perform precursory checks on if some parameters have overlapped, such as $Location_{abs}$ and $Location_{rel}$
	
	\item Lastly, how many functions are needed?
\end{enumerate}

This problem felt like it needed a function that allows varying amounts of arguments like Python's named arguments.

We can either create a function that takes in a struct that holds certain traits, or we can create a class/struct that handles Stutter as a whole. We will go with the latter as the former would be more effective if there are other functions using the traits.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]

struct AMBER_BASE Stutter
{
	double initial_val
	double threshold_val
	double average_val
	
	double threshold_rel
	double threshold_abs
	
}


\end{lstlisting}
