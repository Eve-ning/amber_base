\part{Objects}

\section{Singular}

The simplest block is the Hit Object and Timing Point, these are derived from a osu\_object class.
This makes up the basic building block for both types.

\section{Multiple}

The secondary block would be Hit Object List, and Timing Point List. However, it's important to note that these are not directly derived from hit\_object or timing\_point, these are derived from a template of osu\_object\_v.

Most of the details are not covered as they are more-so self explanatory.
