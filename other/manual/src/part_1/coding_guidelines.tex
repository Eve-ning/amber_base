\part{Coding Guidelines}

\section{Aim}
The main purpose of this guideline is to make sure that any contributor will follow the same focus

\section{Guidelines}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Keep everything stupid simple
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item File names should be as short as possible
		\item Function names should be too
		\item Function inputs should always be constant, functions should always return
		\item More heavy weight functions, less fragmented ones. i.e. overload.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Reuse functions as much as possible
	\item Function names should make as much sense as possible, if not possible, attach a visual
	\item Use folders to group similar functions if needed, however, consider collapsing them into a large function first.
\end{enumerate}
